# My pentest cheatsheet 

This is my pentest cheatsheet I made during OSCP journey :)


## Information Gathering

The first step we should always take is 'Information Gathering' about the target.
Initial fingerprinting is mainly done using 'nmap'.

### nmap options that fingerprinting OS, Services, Ports information
```bash
sudo nmap -A --privileged -sS <IP>
```

### nmap options scanning UDP ports
```bash
sudo nmap -A --privileged -sU <IP>
```

### nmap options that scanning all opend ports (By default, nmap does not scan all ports)
```bash
sudo nmap -p0-65535 -sS -v <IP>
```
